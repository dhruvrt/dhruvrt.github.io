Hey! I am pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.<br/> Currently, I've taken a break from college to launch a startup, Audion Technologies. We are working on Glimpz, a music discovery app that allows you to find music by matching your taste and mood. I will share more details about it as we get closer to the launch in Q1, 2023. 

<br/><br/>I plan to chronicle my startup journey here and share my learnings on various aspects of building a company.
